			<h1>Houdini</h1>
	
			<p>
				As I've used Houdini for producing renders of simulation output along my PhD studies, I've realised that I have hardly scratched the surface of what it's capable of.
				I've decided that when I have some bits of free time I'm going to try and learn a bit more about what Houdini can be used for.
				I'm not an artist so I'm not going to spend loads of time trying to create perfect scenes, but rather just get a bit of a flavour of what you could do, were you an artist.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I've decided to split this page up, as I think it'll be best to keep all of my learnings in one place rather than across lots of pages.
				I've also not tried to do things in any particularly logical order, just picking things out as they seem interesting - maybe I will come to regret this when this page grows into a jumbled mess.

			<h2>1. MPM</h2>
			
			<p>
				I decided that since I have been studying MPM a lot for my own work that it would be interesting to get a feel for it in a production environment.
				I found a course on the SideFx website, <a href="https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/mpm-h205-masterclass/" target="_blank">MPM Houdini Masterclass</a>, and followed through the introductory section.
				I experimented with some of the different materials on offer and created some very simple scenes.

			<p>
				I first started off with a basic scene of 2 different materials a ball of "Jello" in red and a ball of water in blue, alongside a toroidal collider.
				I dropped the resolution so that I could get some results quickly, although I was impressed by the speed of the simulation.
				The course noted that the simulation was run using OpenCL and NanoVDB, both of which I would like to look into at some point.
				
				Since a lot of research in the field of physics-based animation is moving towards GPU implementations, it would be good to spend some time learning more about parallelism and OpenCL seems like it could be a good candidate
				(alongside others such as WebGPU, when I get round to looking into this I'll have to see which language seems best for my needs).
				I've worked on including some parallelism in my own simulations by leveraging OneTBB, but only in a fairly limited way.
				
				In a similar sense, it would be good to look at OpenVDB as this seems to be an industry standard framework.

			<p>
				It is also very easy to set up animated MPM colliders, here I just tried using a rigid animation rather than a deforming animation (which you could use for interactions between MPM and animated characters, for example).

			<p>
				Without having to fiddle with any parameters there's a few materials to play with out of the box with different constitutive models.
				Here's a side-by-side of snow (left), wet mud (middle), and honey (right).
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Leaving it here for now rather than going through the advanced examples in the course, but I'd be interested to play around with this feature more.
				Since I've done some work on multiphase fluids I'd like to try and recreate some of those scenarios in Houdini and compare results.
				I'd also like to compare the MPM water with their FLIP fluids simulation, to see why you would choose to use one over the other when producing scenes in Houdini.
