						<h2>Using The Polynomial Particle-In-Cell Method For Liquid-Fabric Interaction</h2>

						<h3>Abstract </h3>
						
						<div>
							<p>
								Authors: Robert Dennison, Steve Maddock
								<br>
								Liquid-fabric interaction simulations using particle-in-cell (PIC) based models have been used to simulate a wide variety of phenomena and yield impressive visual results.
								However, these models suffer from numerical damping due to the data interpolation between the particles and grid.
								Our paper addresses this by using the polynomial PIC (PolyPIC) model instead of the affine PIC (APIC) model that is used in current state-of-the-art wet cloth models.
								The affine transfers of the APIC model are replaced by the higher order polynomials of PolyPIC, thus reducing numerical dissipation and improving resolution of vorticial details.
								This improved energy preservation enables more dynamic simulations to be generated although this is at an increased computational cost.

								A comparison of fluid splashing onto a medium sized square of yarn fabric using APIC (top) and PolyPIC (bottom) transfers. 
								The colours of the particles indicate their velocities, with red indicating a high velocity and dark blue indicating a low velocity.
								PolyPIC causes more energy to be transferred from the falling fluid to the yarn and results in a more dynamic result.

								A comparison of a fluid splash onto a small piece of cloth using APIC (top) and PolyPIC (bottom) transfers.
								The colours of the particles indicate their velocities, with red indicating a high velocity and dark blue indicating a low velocity.
								The reduced damping means that more fluid splashes off the piece of cloth rather than being absorbed.
								The fluid that is absorbed exhibits more thin strand behaviour as it drips from the cloth in PolyPIC than APIC.
