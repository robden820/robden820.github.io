			<h3>Abstract </h3>
			<p>
				Authors: Robert Dennison, Steve Maddock
				<br>
				Liquid-fabric interaction simulations using particle-in-cell (PIC) based models have been used to simulate a wide variety of phenomena and yield impressive visual results.
				However, these models suffer from numerical damping due to the data interpolation between the particles and grid.
				Our paper addresses this by using the polynomial PIC (PolyPIC) model instead of the affine PIC (APIC) model that is used in current state-of-the-art wet cloth models.
				The affine transfers of the APIC model are replaced by the higher order polynomials of PolyPIC, thus reducing numerical dissipation and improving resolution of vorticial details.
				This improved energy preservation enables more dynamic simulations to be generated although this is at an increased computational cost.
